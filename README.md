# stockAPIGraph

## Tools used:

###### API: 

Polygon 

RESTAPICLIENT

###### Libraries: 

datetime 

pyplot 

dateutil

## How does this project work:

	The program takes in a user input and asks them to enter a stock symbol listed in the NYSE

	The program then takes the current date, and graphs a one year history of the stock using pyplot

	The program then loops back and asks the user if they want to chart another stock or exit

## Things to potentially improve:

	allow user to make a custom date range

	make a GUI to make it simpler to choose a stock or date

	use binary search to filter out potential stocks in the NYSE as the user types in the ticker symbol
